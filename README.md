## VECTORS IN ML

### VECTORS
* It's an array
* The values present in arrays are scalars
```
vector = [1, 2, 3]
```
* In mathematical perspective, vectors has both magnitude and direction
* Example of vector: velocity (denotes speed with direction)
* Scalar has only magnitude
* Example of scalar: speed (denotes speed with no direction)
* Magnitude denotes the length of vector, which means the length from the origin to coordinate
